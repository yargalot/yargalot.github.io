Looks like I finally got around to updating this thing. So lets give this a shot

- I work at carsales.com.au doing Front end development and design for [AutoGate](http://www.datamotive.com.au/autogate2014/), carsales flagship inventory management project
- I have a few open source [projects](https://github.com/yargalot) on github which I update from time to time
- Sometimes I rant on [twitter](https://twitter.com/yargalot)
- Been [travelling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yargalot/) quite a bit
- I enjoy [eating](http://bestfoodcriticever.tumblr.com/)
